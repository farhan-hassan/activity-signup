Activity Sign-Up - Web App developed as an assignment for OCAS.


Technical Details:


Architecture:
============
I have developed this application using the Microservices architecture. I have followed Domain-driven design (DDD) because itâ€™s loosely coupled, highly maintainable and testable. Other common techniques like dependency injection and repository pattern are also utilized wherever needed.


Technologies:
============
All projects (empty) are written from scratch in C# and .Net Core MVC. Client libraries such as Bootstrap and JQuery are used for UI and validation purposes.


Project Structure:
=================
Microservice Projects: [API, Domain and Infrastructure] 
Web App Project: [Web]
